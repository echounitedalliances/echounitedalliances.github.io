/**
 * The departure board, live.
 *
 * It used to ask the database for a list once and print the origin airport's
 * own clock string. Two things were wrong with that. The query had no time
 * filter, so it always returned the earliest departures of the day and the
 * board sat frozen on a row of 00:00 flights. And a bare "00:00" carries no
 * zone, so a viewer in Ho Chi Minh City and a viewer in Boston were both shown
 * a number that meant nothing to either of them.
 *
 * board_departures returns departs_at as a real instant, so rendering it is
 * Intl's problem. It is rendered in the AIRPORT's zone, not the viewer's,
 * because that is what a departure board is: the times on the screen at
 * Changi are Singapore's, whoever is reading them. Showing a Frankfurt board
 * on a Melbourne clock was technically defensible and practically useless.
 *
 * It also no longer asks where the viewer is. It used to send the browser's
 * timezone so the database could pick the hub the viewer was probably
 * standing in, which is a location guess nobody asked to make. The board now
 * opens at the alliance's busiest airport and lets anyone choose any other --
 * not just the six biggest, which was the other half of the same complaint.
 *
 * Three clocks, on purpose, because they cost different amounts:
 *   - the flights are refetched once a minute (a network round trip),
 *   - the countdowns are recomputed every fifteen seconds (a re-render),
 *   - the wall clock ticks every second (one isolated component).
 * Keeping the seconds hand in its own component is what stops the board's 376
 * character cells from re-rendering once a second for the sake of a colon.
