/**
 * The code of conduct and the privacy notice.
 *
 * Written plainly and specifically, because generic boilerplate would be
 * worse than nothing here: this is a hobby group of a few hundred people
 * playing a game, and the only personal data in the building is a Discord
 * handle attached to an application and an email address attached to a
 * Resonance account. Saying exactly that is more use to an applicant than a
 * page of clauses about "affiliates and processors".
 *
 * Everything here is checkable against the code, and the page now says so on
 * the page rather than only in this comment:
 *   joining               -> components/Join.tsx (links out; posts nothing)
 *   accounts              -> lib/auth.tsx, components/ResonanceAuth.tsx
 *   the visitor counter   -> lib/presence.ts
 *   browser storage       -> lib/advisories.ts, and Supabase's own session
 *   who can read what     -> database/sql/08_rls_policies.sql
 *   admin requests        -> database/sql/28_admin_applications.sql
 *
 * If any of those change, this changes with them. A privacy notice that has
 * drifted from what the software does is the one kind that actively harms.
